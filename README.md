jsdocgen
========
API documentation generator and viewer.

**Features:**
- Generates the documentation quickly, a library of ~200 PHP files takes ~3 seconds on a below average laptop.
- Designed with support of several languages in mind.
- Markdown support, no ugly XML/HTML in the docs.
- Each method/property/function is displayed on a separate page, not in a single page for the class.
- Decent looking GUI, unmixed with the docs themselves.
- No external dependencies to install.

Status
------
The project currently supports only PHP but other languages (JavaScript, Java)
are planned for the next release. The project version is 0.9 and is considered
beta because it is not tested for long period and it may have rough edges. The
PHP support is almost fully complete. All OOP features of PHP 5.4 are
supported + functions, the only thing that is not implemented is the
@inheritdoc tag to inherit docs from parent class, but there is autoinherit
functionality for class methods without own doc comments. Documenting global
variables or constants is not supported at the moment and currently there are
no plans for adding such support. If necessary these elements can be described
in the file level doc comment. The focus of jsdocgen is towards class
libraries and there is limited ability to document scripts.

The project is tested on Windows, OSX and Linux.



Very quick start
----------------
There are no dependencies (besides PHP 5.4 itself) or anything of this sort,
all you need to do is unzip jsdocgen, prepare your project and type two
commands in the shell. The quickest way to build some docs is to use the
bundled example.

1. Open a shell to the folder of this readme.
2. Parse the sources of the project  
   
   ```sh
   jsdocgen -lang=php -projectdir=example -outdir=example/build/docs -intro=example/intro.md -autoinherit
   ```
   
   If we wanted the command to be absolutely minimal we could omit the
   `-intro` and `-autoinherit`.   
   
3. Build the viewer (front end) for your project  
   
   ```sh
   jsdocgen build -lang=php -outdir=example/build -def=ProjectName:Example -def=ProjectSubtitle:Project
   ```
   
   If we wanted the command to be absolutely minimal we could omit the two
   `-def` arguments.
   
4. Browse to `example/build/index.html` or check the screenshot in
   [example/screenshot.png](example/screenshot.png)
5. Everything in the build directory would be your docs. You need to
   redistribute everything that is in there.


The output of the first command should look similar to this, and the second
command is not expected to output anything:

```
Looking for sources...

Usage
=====
This is guide how to write docs for jsdocgen and how to build these docs from
the sources. Here only PHP is covered and the rest of the guide assumes PHP
sources. Building the docs for other languages would be very similar but there
might be some language related differences which are documented elsewhere.

jsdocgen is split in two parts - parser and viewer. The parser extracts the
documentation from the project sources and converts it to more portable format
(JSON). The viewer loads the formatted docs and displays them in the browser.


Writing some documentation
--------------------------
Writing documentation for jsdocgen is very similar to other system like
PHPDocumentor or Doxygen. Actually the project started because PHPDocumentor
couldn't serve my needs any more. If you already have documentation in
PHPDocumentor format it will mostly work without changes. There are minor
differences that can be changed with few simple "replace in files" commands.
That doesn't mean jsdocgen strives for compatibility, but it is based on what
I was familiar with. Unlike other popular documentation systems, the
descriptions of jsdocgen are in markdown format, making them easier to read
and write (in contrast to using HTML/XML) and suitable for formatting large
volumes of text.


### Doc comments
Doc comments are block comments with additional asterisk in the opening
comment. They can be in PHPDocumentor format:

```
/**
 * Where
 * each line
 * starts with
 * another star
 * & each star is
 * aligned with space
 */
```

Or you can skip the stars and just write your docs.

```
/**
Stars are looking good but
I find them one of the reasons
why I write less docs. They are
not keyboard friendly.
*/
```

A doc comment consists of:
- Optional one line summary.
- Optional, possibly multiline, description.
- List of tags. Each tag has a name and optional value. The value spans from after the name
(+ one space) to the start of the next tag.
- No tags before the summary or the description.
- `/**` and `*/` reside on their own lines, not with the actual comments.
- All lines after `/**` must have same indentation, including `*/`.
  This indentation may differ from the indent before the `/**`.
- Newlines will be converted to Unix format.

```
/**
 * This is a docblock summary (summary).
 * (description:) The asterisks at the beginning of lines,
 * together with the white space
 * will be trimmed.
 * @tags start after the description. The tag here is "tags".
 * @another tag - the tag here is
 * "another", this one spans multiple lines.
 */
```

The first doc comment in the file, just after the opening PHP
tag, is a file-level block.

The text of the summary, the description and the description
of each tag that has free form text is in markdown format.


### Markdown
The markdown is mostly compatible with "GitHub Flavoured Markdown".
- [GFM](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown)
- [GFM Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

Additionally:
- `~~~` can be used for code blocks (GitHub also supports this)
- `[Internal link][^anchor-name]` will link to an anchor placed elsewhere in
  the same document.
- `[^anchor-name]:` will place and anchor (it will be invisible)
- This is `___underline___`.
- This is `--strike through--`.
- Line breaks inside headers.
- GFM line breaks (enter) are not respected. Always two trailing spaces and a
  newline to insert a line break.
- `\b` will delete the previous character. This is useful if, for example, you
  want to type `*/` without closing the comment. You can write it as `* \b/`
  and it will show as `*/`.
- Additional escape characters: `~` `<` `>` `/` `|` and `space` and `tab`.


### Basic tags:
These are common tags that apply to all source elements.

`@package <package[.subpackage.subsub...]>`  
Only supported in the file level block, marks all elements in this file as
belonging to a package. If this tag is missing, the file will be assigned to
the default package (which can be user defined).

`@private`  
The element of the doc comment is marked private. It will not show in the
viewer.

`@deprecated [description]`  
Marks the API as deprecated and shows a warning.

`@author <author>`  
Puts an author field in the meta section.

`@license <license>`  
Puts a license field in the meta section.

`@copyright <copyright>`  
Puts a copyright field in the meta section.

`@todo <todo text>`  
Not implemented at the moment.

`@see <target> [description]`  
Creates a 'see also' section and puts an entry with link there. The see target
can be one of the following formats:

- `function()`
- `Class` or `\Full\Class\Name`
- `Class::$property`
- `Class::constant`
- `Class::method()`
- `php:PHP_builtin_symbol` where 'PHP_builtin_symbol' can be any of the above.
- `file/relative/tothe/projectdir.php`
- `http://url.com`

If classes and functions are not expressed with their full form (with
namespace prefix) they are resolved by looking for them in the current
namespace or class and then in the global namespace. In the context of a class
'function()' can refer to a method of the same class named 'function', the
class prefix can be omitted. Also the 'php:' prefix for built symbols can be
omitted and jsdocgen will attempt to autodetect that the symbol comes with
PHP.


### Inline tags
These can be inlined in another tags' description.

`{@see <target> [description]}`  
The same as `@see` but will not create a 'see also' section and instead
show the link where the tags is.


### Context specific tags

`@param <type> [description]`  
Can appear in the context of functions and methods. One `@param` tag can be
placed for each function argument, in the same order. The 'type' describes the
type of the variable that this argument accepts. If the argument contains a
type hint, only the type hint is taken into account and everything in the
@param tag is considered a description. Type can refer to any class with its
full or short name, also to builtin PHP types or can be array of type, e.g.
array of strings `string[]`. Other types that will not show as links include
`mixed`, `int`, `float`, `string`, `null`, `function`, `callback`. Multiple
types can be separated with a pipe, e.g. `string|float[]`.

`@return <type> [description]`  
Can appear in the context of functions and methods. Describes the return value
of the function. The type is in the same format as in `@param` and
additionally type `$this` can indicate the method can be used for chain calls.

`@throws <type> [description]`  
Can appear in the context of a function or method. Indicates that the function
may throw exception. 'type' is the same as in `@param`.

`@vaarg [description]`  
Can appear in the context of functions and methods. Indicates the function
accepts variable number of arguments.

`@var <type> [description]`  
Can appear in the context of a property to describe the type of this property.
'type' is the same as in `@param`. If this tag appears and it has description,
but there is no doc comment summary, the description of the tag will be put in
the place of the doc comment summary.



Generating the docs
-------------------
Once you populate your sources with doc comments you can use jsdocgen to parse
the sources and generate docs in a format it can display. The process is
twofold. First you invoke the parser, then you build the front end to make it
specific for your project - to have your project's title and know about the
location of your docs. The frontend needs to be built only once (unless you
want to update), while the docs will be re-generated many times while you work
and change them.


### Parsing the sources
Before starting the parser it is important to understand how it works. It uses
PHP's built in reflection capabilities, so to parse the sources it actually
includes them in a PHP script. The downside of this approach is it can only
parse libraries. On the upside it is fast. If you attempt to parse scripts
that perform actions, not just declare classes, these scripts will actually be
executed and may do something unwanted.

Before executing any scripts, the parser will define a constant named
`JSDOCGEN_PHP_PARSER`, so if you need to tweak your sources for the parsing
step, you can identify that the script is started by jsdocgen by checking if
this constant is defined.

Additionally most libraries require some kind of autoloading mechanism or
other setup. If your project needs such step you can create a small script
that the parser will perform before including any sources.

#### Example
Lets look at the quick start example in details:

```sh
jsdocgen -lang=php -projectdir=example -outdir=example/build/docs -intro=example/intro.md -autoinherit
```

`-lang=php` is mandatory since extended language supported is planned for the
next release.

`-projectdir` is mandatory and tells jsdocgen where to look for source files.

`-outdir` tell jsdocgen where to put the generated docs. If the directory does
not exist it will be created. Strictly speaking this argument is optional but
who wants to look for their sources in the temp folder. This directory will be
filled with a lot of files that are not immediately useful, so you probably
want them in a subfolder of where your docs will be. In this case the root of
the docs is 'example/build' and this is where the viewer is placed, and 'docs'
is the subfolder.

`-intro` tells jsdocgen to parse this file as markdown and show it on the
front, before any API is selected.

`-autoinherit` will make jsdocgen attemt to automatically inherit
documentation for class members without a doc comment. For example if you have
interface which defines a method and class which implements this interface.
But the method is not implemented by the class but by a trait that the class
uses. If the method is documented in the interface, jsdocgen will be able to
inherit its documentation for all classes that implement it (if the doc
comment of the method implementation is omitted).

The important option that you will most likely need to include a setup script
is `-phpinit=<location>` to point to the location of your setup script. This
setup can boot your autoloader or just include some files so there won't be
any undefined classes when your sources are included.

The "TravelSDK Core" from the demo section is not using special init script
for the docs at all, it is directly including its own init script from the
command line. But if it was to use init script for the documentation it would
look like this - just a single line to include the autoloader of the library:

```php
<?

require_once __DIR__ . '/../../lib/travelsdk-core-php/src/init.php';

?>
```

Additional useful options are `-warnings` or `-strict` which will display
warning messages about the documentation if, for example, there is a `@see`
tag that points to invalid symbol. This helps keeping your docs in good shape.

For all available options see "Using the parser" bellow.


### Building the front end
Onece the documentation is built from sources we need to build the front end
that displays them. This front end needs a building step so it knows about the
name of your project. It only needs to be built once and not every time the
documentation is rebuilt.

#### Example
Again the example from the quick start:  

```sh
jsdocgen build -lang=php -outdir=example/build -def=ProjectName:Example -def=ProjectSubtitle:Project
```

`build` means we will be building the viewer, not generating docs.

`-lang` must match the language of the generated docs.

`-outdir` is where the viewer's main file (index.html) will be placed.

The two `-def` arguments define some variables that will be hardcoded in the
viewer while building it.

By default the viewer will look for the docs in subfolder of where it is
placed named 'docs'. If you choose a different location you also need to
provide `-docslocation=<location>` argument. Location points to a folder
relative to the viewer's root.



Using the parser
================
The parser is started with a command from the shell.

```
jsdocgen OPTIONS
```

OPTIONS
-------

```
-lang=language
```
Required. Language of the project to parse. Supported languages are: "php".


```
-projectdir=path
```
Required. Path where project sources are located.


```
-outdir=path
```
Optional. Path where the output files will be stored. Defaults to the system
temp directory.  


```
-pattern=pattern
```
Optional. Pattern(s) in the -projectdir used to recognize source files. There
is default based on the selected -lang. For example for PHP the default
pattern is to look inside all subdirectories for .php files.

Patterns are simple regular expressions. `*` matches everything but forward
slash `/`, and `**` matches everything. Non greedy and only forward slashes
are supported (they work fine on Windows). For example `*.php` will match all
files with extension 'php' in the same directory. `**.php` will match all
files with extension 'php' in the same directory and all sub directories.
Multiple patterns can be delimited with a pipe `|`. For example
`*.php4|*.php5` will match all files with extension 'php4' or 'php5'.
Additionally a list of exclude patterns can be appended after a colon `:`.
Files and directories matching one of the exclude patterns will be filtered
out.

More examples:
- `*.cpp` will match "file.cpp" but not "dir/file.cpp".
- `**.cpp` will match "dir/file.cpp" and "file.cpp".
- `**/*.cpp` will match "dir/file.cpp" and "dir/subdir/file.cpp" but not
    "file.cpp".
- `**/**/*.cpp` will match "dir/subdir/file.cpp" but not "dir/file.cpp" and
    "file.cpp".


```
-intro=path
```
Optional. File to use as intro page, before any API is selected. The format is
the same as the descriptions in the doc comments of the selected language.


```
-defaultpackage=packagename
```
Optional. Put symbols without package in this one. The effect of this also
depends on the actual language.


```
-withprivatemembers
```
Optional. Will include doc comments which are marked with `@private` or
private class members, which are otherwise excluded from the generated
documentation.


```
-warnings
```
Optional. Will print warnings about errors that will not prevent the docs from
working, but may hinder quality.


```
-strict
```
Optional. Will treat all warnings as errors (does not depend on the -warnings
option).


```
-autonotices
```
Optional. Displays console message when doing something automatically like
detecting see symbols (see -phpautosee), or automatically inheriting missing
documentation for class methods and such (see -autoinherit).


```
-autoinherit
```
Optional. Will attempt to inherit documentation for inherited class members
which don't have a doc comment. The effect of this depends on the actual
language.


```
-debug
```
Optional. Shows debug info and keeps intermediate files.


```
-cache
```
Optional. Use caching if possible. Used while debugging to avoid parsing
sources if they were not changed.



PHP specific options
--------------------

If no pattern is specified, the pattern for this parser defaults to
`**.php:.*|**/.*` which is to include all files with php extension recursively
and to exclude all files and folders starting with a dot.

**Warning:**  
This parser uses PHP's built in reflection capabilities, so to parse the
sources it actually includes them in a PHP script. This means it can only
parse libraries. If you attempt to parse scripts that perform actions, these
scripts will actually be executed and may do something unwanted.

Before executing any scripts, the parser will define a constant named
`JSDOCGEN_PHP_PARSER`, so if you need to tweak your sources for the parsing
step, you can identify that the script is started by jsdocgen by checking if
this constant is defined.


```
-phpinit=setup_script
```
Optional. Setup script for the project. Some libraries need some
initialization like including their autoloader. This script will be performed
before any other source file.


```
-phpbin=path
```
Optional. Path to the PHP binary to use. Defaults to "php" and it should be in
the system path for the default to work.


```
-phpautosee
```
Optional. Attempts to detect and link symbol references like methods() and
classes::etc() in the descriptions, as if they were enclosed in a `{@see}`
tag. Use with caution as this feature is not fully implemented and could
interfere with markdown and/or HTML tags.


```
-phpextrafiles="file1[|file2|file3...]"
```
Optional. Pipe delimited list of additional files to parse for their
file-level doc comment. The files in this list are parsed **only for their
file-level doc comment**. Other elements will not be included. These files may
be scripts as they will not be included by the PHP parser as the rest of the
sources, only read as plain text and their first comment extracted.
